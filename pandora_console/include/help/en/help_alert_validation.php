<h1>Alert validations</h1>
<p>
Validating an alert only changes its status bit and cleans the &laquo;triggered&raquo;, this way if the alert is triggered again, the process just continues. This is oriented to alerts with larger thresholds, for example, 1 day. If you get an alert, check it and mark it as read, you’ll probably want to establish the status to green and won’t want to wait 1 day until it’s green again.
